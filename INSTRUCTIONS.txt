Simple Description: create a web page that allows users to transfer any crypto currency items/tokens, but only on certain networks

Detailed Description:

Create a web page that has the following features:
1. allow user to connect a metamask wallet (or other compatible wallet)
2. ONLY when a wallet is connected the user may select which item to transfer (contract address, item ID (ONLY for ERC-721 and ERC-1155), amount (ONLY for ERC-20, and ERC-1155)), and the destination address
  - Optional: automatically detect the token standard. If you don't do this you must allow the user to specify the standard
  - Optional: dispaly the user's current balance of the selected token
3. Call the transfer function of the token to complete the transfer

Only support the following networks:
 - Polygon
 - BSC
 - Rinkeby
 
If the user is not connected to one of these networks, inform them of the compatible networks and do not let them transfer any items.
(Optional: include buttons to switch to one of the supported networks)

All necessary ABIs are included in index.js (ERC20Abi, ERC721Abi, ERC1155Abi)
